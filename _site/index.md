## About me

Hey, I'm Mike.

Originally from Shenyang, China, I am currently working in Hong Kong as a full stack developer. The extensive background in mobile, and backend development has made me master the skills in technical design, software development, and CI/CD configuration, etc. In addition, passionately fond of guitar, painting and cooking food as my hobby, my life is always full of sunshine. I am a quick learner and ready for any challenge!
